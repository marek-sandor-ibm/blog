You need to find the TLS NodePort on your cluster that is used by the Db2 database.
OpenShiftÂ®
```
oc -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} get svc | grep db2u-engn-svc
```
Consider the following example output:
```
mpp2-db2u-engn-svc    NodePort    10.0.86.99     <none>        50000:32209/TCP,50001:31050/TCP      20h
```

Configure your database client application to use that NodePort value when it connects to the database with the installed TLS certificate.
Using the previous example, you would configure your client application to use 10.0.86.99 as the IP address and port 31050 to connect to the Db2 database server that is running on the Cloud Pak for Data cluster.
